# Emotion_classif
Deep Learning project for Emotion Classification

This repository contains a Python machine learning project focused on emotion classification using complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project incorporates advanced computer vision techniques for face detection and feature recognition. The model is trained and validated on sample videos, with an output video included to demonstrate its performance.

Key Features:

    Face detection using computer vision
    Feature recognition for emotion classification
    Training and validation of CNN models
    Output video demonstrating model performance

## Output Video

The performance of the emotion classification model is demonstrated in the following video:
